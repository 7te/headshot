The `master` branch is the current working branch. The `master` branch may not be in working condition and will likely change as the tutorial is develpoed. Only use `master` if you are looking for the latest code from the tutorial.

For the finished project from certain parts of the tutorial, check for a branch called `part_number`, where `number` is the finished part you are looking for. For example, the finished project for parts 1 through 3 is called `part_3`. 

If you cannot find a branch for the specific part you are looking for, choose the next closest branch that is smaller than the part you are looking for and work your way up to the part you are looking for.

(NOTE: for part 1 and part 2 of the FPS tutorial, you will have to go the the Godot documentation page and download the starter assets provided [in part 1](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/3d/fps_tutorial/part_one.html). This repository did not exist when part 1 through 3 was being worked on, so there is no `part_1`, or `part_2` branches)
